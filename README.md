## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned by removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and converting data types where necessary.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various visualizations are created to analyze the relationship between customer demographics and sales data.
- **Key Insights**: Analysis of gender, age group, marital status, state, occupation, product category, and most sold products.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Cleaning**:
    - Removed blank columns (`Status` and `unnamed1`).
    - Dropped rows with missing values in the `Amount` column.
    - Renamed the `Marital_Status` column to `Shaadi`.
    - Changed the `Amount` column data type to `int`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Visualized the distribution of sales by gender, age group, marital status, state, occupation, and product category.
    - Generated bar plots for the total amount and number of orders by gender, age group, marital status, state, and product category.
    - Identified the top 10 most sold products and the states with the highest sales.

3. **Key Findings**:
    - Married women in the 26-35 age group from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, particularly in the IT sector, tend to make more purchases.
    - The most popular product categories include **Food**, **Clothing**, and **Electronics**.

## Visualizations

- **Gender vs Total Amount**: A bar plot showing the total sales amount by gender.
